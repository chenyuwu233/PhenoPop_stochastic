 *  'main_Performance_test_P.m': main script for estimation from the mixture data.
 *
 *      Expected outcome: 
 *          The results are saved as 'BF_'+data number+'.mat'. (AIC value in table 4 is recorded here)
 *
 *  'main_Performance_test_MONO.m': main script for estimation from the monoclonal data.
 *
 *      Expected outcome: 
 *          The results are saved as data name+'HL_MONO.mat'. (AIC value in table 4 is recorded here)
 *
 *  'Plot_pe_in_vitro.m': Script for generating point estimation plot (Figure 18,19).
 *  
 *  'plot_residual.m': Script for generating the estimation residual plot (Figure 20).
